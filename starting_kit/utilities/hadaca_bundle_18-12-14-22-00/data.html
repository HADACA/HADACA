<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This dataset is a small set of patients which have been diagnotised at different stages of cancer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>It contains 10 classes of 500 instances each, where each class refers to a cancer stage and each instance refers to a patient. There are 5000 features, which correspond to methylation information related to the medical condition of each patient.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We provide sample_data with the starting kit to make this notebook work and illustrative, but to prepare your submission and realize actual experiments, you must fetch the public_data from the challenge website. Only using the whole training set, you will be able to achieve interesting classification results, and eventually improve our weak baseline.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Go to the <b>FILES</b> tab to download the data and the starting kit. The starting kit contains a very small subset of the data for debug purposes. To prepare a challenge submission, you need to use the large dataset that you download separately. For the large dataset, you do NOT have the labels!</span></p>
